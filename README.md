## 🎮 Project Structure

ba-by.ca/
│
├─ index.html → Main landing page (clouds, sun, 3D cards)
├─ assets/ → Images, CSS, JS (optional future use)
│ ├─ images/

│
├─ abc/
├─ colors/
├─ sounds/
├─ puzzles/
├─ rooftoprush/
├─ dino/
├─ shapes/
└─ numbers/


Each game folder contains its own **index.html**, so the route becomes:

- a-by.ca/abc/
- a-by.ca/colors/
- a-by.ca/sounds/
- …and so on.
